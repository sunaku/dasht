dasht\-query\-html \- searches Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets and emits HTML table rows
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-html\fR [\fIPATTERN\fP] [\fIDOCSET\fP]...
.SS Examples
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-html\fR
Topics (A\-Z) from each installed docset.
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-html\fR 'c \- x'
Search for "c \- x" in all installed docsets.
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-html\fR 'c \- x' bash
Search for "c \- x" only in the "bash" docset.
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-html\fR 'c \- x' bash css
Search for "c \- x" only in the "bash" and "css" docsets.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Searches for \fIPATTERN\fP in all installed Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets, optionally searching
only in those whose names match \fIDOCSET\fPs, by calling 
.BR dasht-query-line (1).

The results are then printed, one per line, to stdout as HTML table rows.
However, if no results were found, this program exits with a nonzero status.
.SS Searching
.PP
Whitespace characters in \fIPATTERN\fP are treated as wildcards, whereas the
SQL LIKE wildcard characters \fB\fC%\fR and \fB\fC_\fR are not: they are taken literally.
.PP
Before searching, \fIPATTERN\fP is surrounded by whitespace wildcards so that it
can match anywhere: beginning, middle, or end.  As a result, if \fIPATTERN\fP is
undefined, it becomes a whitespace wildcard and thereby matches everything.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fB\fCDASHT_DOCSETS_DIR\fR
Defines the filesystem location where your Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets are installed.
If undefined, its value is assumed to be \fB\fC$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/\fR
or, if \fB\fCXDG_DATA_HOME\fR is undefined, \fB\fC$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/\fR\&.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
44
No results were found.
