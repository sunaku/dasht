.SH NAME
.PP
dasht\-query\-line \- searches Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets and emits TSV table rows
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-line\fR [\fIPATTERN\fP] [\fIDOCSET\fP]...
.SS Examples
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-line\fR
Topics (A\-Z) from each installed docset.
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-line\fR 'c \- x'
Search for "c \- x" in all installed docsets.
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-line\fR 'c \- x' bash
Search for "c \- x" only in the "bash" docset.
.TP
\fB\fCdasht\-query\-line\fR 'c \- x' bash css
Search for "c \- x" only in the "bash" and "css" docsets.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Searches for \fIPATTERN\fP in all installed Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets, optionally searching
only in those whose names match \fIDOCSET\fPs, by calling 
.BR dasht-query-exec (1)

and emits the results, one per line, in Tab\-Separated Values (TSV) format.
However, if no results were found, this program exits with a nonzero status.
.SS Searching
.PP
Whitespace characters in \fIPATTERN\fP are treated as wildcards, whereas the
SQL LIKE wildcard characters \fB\fC%\fR and \fB\fC_\fR are not: they are taken literally.
.PP
Before searching, \fIPATTERN\fP is surrounded by whitespace wildcards so that it
can match anywhere: beginning, middle, or end.  As a result, if \fIPATTERN\fP is
undefined, it becomes a whitespace wildcard and thereby matches everything.
.SS Results
.PP
Each search result is printed stdout as a line with 4 tab\-separated fields:
.TP
\fB\fCname\fR
Name of the token that matched the \fIPATTERN\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\fCtype\fR
Type of the token, as defined in the docset.
.TP
\fB\fCfrom\fR
Name of the docset this result was found in.
.TP
\fB\fCurl\fR
URL of the API documentation for this result.
.PP
For example, here is a search result for "c \- x" from the "bash" docset,
with the tab separators represented by \fB\fC<TAB>\fR for illustrative purposes:
.PP

.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fB\fCDASHT_DOCSETS_DIR\fR
Defines the filesystem location where your Dash \[la]https://kapeli.com/dash\[ra] docsets are installed.
If undefined, its value is assumed to be \fB\fC$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/\fR
or, if \fB\fCXDG_DATA_HOME\fR is undefined, \fB\fC$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/\fR\&.
.TP
\fB\fCDASHT_USE_DASH_APP\fR
Set to "true" to use Dash.app's (MacOS only) docset library. Disables
docset management commands (install, remove, update). Also changes the
default \fB\fCDASHT_DOCSETS_DIR\fR to "~/Library/Application Support/Dash".
.SH EXIT STATUS
