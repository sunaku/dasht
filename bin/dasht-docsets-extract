# # DASHT-DOCSETS-EXTRACT 1       2020-05-16                            2.4.0
#
# ## NAME
#
# dasht-docsets-extract - extracts [Dash] docset archives (`*.tgz` files)
#
# ## SYNOPSIS
#
# `dasht-docsets-extract` *FILE*...
#
# ### Examples
#
# `dasht-docsets-extract` NET\_Framework.tgz
#   Extracts the [Dash] docset archive file named "NET\_Framework.tgz" that is
#   located in the current working directory.
#
# `dasht-docsets-extract` NET\_Framework.tgz Font\_Awesome.tgz
#   Extracts the [Dash] docset archive files named "NET\_Framework.tgz" and
#   "Font\_Awesome.tgz" that are located in the current working directory.
#
# `dasht-docsets-extract` ../some\_path\_here/NET\_Framework.tgz
#   Extracts the [Dash] docset archive file named "NET\_Framework.tgz" that is
#   located in a subdirectory one level above the current working directory.
#
# ## DESCRIPTION
#
# Extracts the given [Dash] docset archive *FILE*s (`*.tgz` files) into the
# location specified by the `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR` environment variable and then
# renames their extracted directories to match their rootnames (sans `.tgz`).
#
# If an extracted directory already exists, its contents are updated in place.
#
# ## ENVIRONMENT
#
# `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR`
#   Defines the filesystem location where your [Dash] docsets are installed.
#   If undefined, its value is assumed to be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/`
#   or, if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is undefined, `$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/`.
#
# `DASHT_USE_DASH_APP`
#   Set to "true" to use Dash.app's (MacOS only) docset library. Disables
#   docset management commands (install, remove, update). Also changes the
#   default `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR` to "~/Library/Application Support/Dash".
#
# ## EXIT STATUS
#
# 46
#   Command was not executed because `DASHT_USE_DASH_APP` is set.
#
