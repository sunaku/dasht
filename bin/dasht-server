#
# ## NAME
#
# dasht-server - runs a local search engine for your web browser
#
# ## SYNOPSIS
#
# `dasht-server` [*PORT*]
#
# ### Examples
#
# `dasht-server`
#   Starts a local search engine at <http://127.0.0.1:54321>.
#
# `dasht-server` 8080
#   Starts a local search engine on port number 8080.
#
# ## DESCRIPTION
#
# Runs a local search engine on *PORT* number, at <http://127.0.0.1:PORT>,
# which can only be accessed by web browsers running on the local machine.
# If no *PORT* number is specified, then its value is assumed to be 54321.
#
# The search engine's URL is printed to stdout, for the user's reference,
# which can be used to launch a web browser along with the search engine:
#
#     dasht-server | xargs -n1 w3m
#
# ## ENVIRONMENT
#
# `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR`
#   Defines the filesystem location where your [Dash] docsets are installed.
#   If undefined, its value is assumed to be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/`
#   or, if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is undefined, `$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/`.
#
# `DASHT_USE_DASH_APP`
#   Set to "true" to use Dash.app's (MacOS only) docset library. Disables
#   docset management commands (install, remove, update). Also changes the
#   default `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR` to "~/Library/Application Support/Dash".
