# ## NAME
#
# dasht - API documentation in your terminal
#
# ## SYNOPSIS
#
# `dasht` [*PATTERN*] [*DOCSET*]...
#
# ### Examples
#
# `dasht`
#   Topics (A-Z) from each installed docset.
#
# `dasht` 'c - x'
#   Search for "c - x" in all installed docsets.
#
# `dasht` 'c - x' bash
#   Search for "c - x" only in the "bash" docset.
#
# `dasht` 'c - x' bash css
#   Search for "c - x" only in the "bash" and "css" docsets.
#
# ## DESCRIPTION
#
# Searches for *PATTERN* in all installed [Dash] docsets, optionally searching
# only in those whose names match *DOCSET*s, by calling dasht-query-html(1).
# The results, if any, are then displayed in the w3m(1) terminal web browser,
# which terminates when you press the `q` key, just as typical UNIX pagers do.
# If no results were found, says so on stderr and exits with a nonzero status.
#
# ### Searching
#
# Whitespace characters in *PATTERN* are treated as wildcards, whereas the
# SQL LIKE wildcard characters `%` and `_` are not: they are taken literally.
#
# Before searching, *PATTERN* is surrounded by whitespace wildcards so that it
# can match anywhere: beginning, middle, or end.  As a result, if *PATTERN* is
# undefined, it becomes a whitespace wildcard and thereby matches everything.
#
# ## ENVIRONMENT
#
# `DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR`
#   Defines the filesystem location where your [Dash] docsets are installed.
#   If undefined, its value is assumed to be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/`
#   or, if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is undefined, `$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/`.
